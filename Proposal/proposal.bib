	abstract = {In this paper, we describe our work on discovering missing links in Wikipedia articles. This task is important for both readers and authors of Wikipedia. The readers will benefit from the increased article quality with better navigation support. On the other hand, the system can be employed to support the authors during editing. This study combines the strengths of different approaches previously applied for the task, and adds its own techniques to reach satisfactory results. Because of the subjectivity in the nature of the task; automatic evaluation is hard to apply. Comparing approaches seems to be the best method to evaluate new techniques, and we offer a semi-automatized method for evaluation of the results. The recall is calculated automatically using existing links in Wikipedia. The precision is calculated according to manual evaluations of human assessors. Comparative results for different techniques are presented, showing the success of our improvements. We employ Turkish Wikipedia, we are the first to study on it, to examine whether a small instance is scalable enough for such purposes.},

	author = {Suchanek, Fabian M. and Kasneci, Gjergji and Weikum, Gerhard},

	abstract = {We present {YAGO}, a light-weight and extensible ontology with high coverage and quality. {YAGO} builds on entities and relations and currently contains roughly 900,000 entities and 5,000,000 facts. This includes the Is-A hierarchy as well as non-taxonomic relations between entities (such as hasWonPrize). The facts have been automatically extracted from the unification of Wikipedia and WordNet, using a carefully designed combination of rule-based and heuristic methods described in this paper. The resulting knowledge base is a major step beyond WordNet: in quality by adding knowledge about individuals like persons, organizations, products, etc. with their semantic relationships -- and in quantity by increasing the number of facts by more than an order of magnitude. Our empirical evaluation of fact correctness shows an accuracy of about 95%. {YAGO} is based on a logically clean model, which is decidable, extensible, and compatible with {RDFS}. Finally, we show how {YAGO} can be further extended by state-of-the-art information extraction techniques.},

	title = {Semantic taxonomy induction from heterogenous evidence},
	author = {Rion Snow},
	year = {2006},
	abstract = {We propose a novel algorithm for inducing semantic taxonomies. Previous algorithms for taxonomy induction have typically focused on independent classifiers for discovering new single relationships based on hand-constructed or automatically discovered textual patterns. By contrast, our algorithm flexibly incorporates evidence from multiple classifiers over heterogenous relationships to optimize the entire structure of the taxonomy, using knowledge of a word�s coordinate terms to help in determining its hypernyms, and vice versa. We apply our algorithm on the problem of sense-disambiguated noun hyponym acquisition, where we combine the predictions of hypernym and coordinate term classifiers with the knowledge in a preexisting semantic taxonomy (WordNet 2.1). We add 10, 000 novel synsets to WordNet 2.1 at 84 % precision, a relative error reduction of 70 % over a non-joint algorithm using the same component classifiers. Finally, we show that a taxonomy built using our algorithm shows a 23 % relative F-score improvement over WordNet 2.1 on an independent testset of hypernym pairs. 1},
